![](Nestle_Picture2.png)

## Objectives
- Evaluate Current Product Performance: Understand how existing products are performing in the market.
- Inform Expansion Plans: Use insights to guide decisions on introducing new product lines.
- Identify Strong and Weak Performers: Identify products with high market demand and profitability as well as those underperforming.

## Introduction
Nestlé is the largest food company in the world, marketing over 8,500 brands and 30,000 products. Nestlé is considering expanding its business by introducing new product lines. However, before doing so, there is a need to assess the performance of the current products to make informed strategic decisions.

## Problem Statement

- What is the trend of total sales per product in the last 3 years?
- What is the monthly sales trend?
- Compare the different products based on the maximum and min revenue generated?
- Which location had the highest and lowest sales?
- Generate insights from the sales medium to help the Head of Growth take a decision?

## Skills Demonstrated
The following Power BI features were incorporated.

DAX Query Function,
Modelling
Filters

I was able to add to my skill by learning and using the **DAX Query Function**. This can be seen in the calculated **KPIS**.

## Data Transformation/Cleaning:

Data was efficiently cleaned and transformed with the Power Query Editor of Power BI. After checking all the columns and rows, they were found to be valid and devoid of empty cells and errors. The data contains 254083 rows and 18 columns.

- Making first row as headers on the data.

- Datatype then changed from 'DECIMAL' to 'WHOLE NUMBERS'.

- ADDING NEW MEASURES to calculate for the KPIS.

## Data Modelling

The data has only one table and so there was no data modelling done for the analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visuals

Sales is highest in the country Germany with almost $11.1bn.

## Conclusions & Recommendations

- From the dashboard, it was observed that the channel that generated the highest sales is **Pharmacy** **$6.2bn** and the **Hospital** generate **$5.5bn sales**.

- **Ionclotide** has the highest sales product of **$169M** followed by **Tetratanly** of **$126M**.

- The **Delta sales team** generated the highest sales of **$3.6bn** and the **Alfa sales team** had the least sales of **$2.6bn**.

- **Gerlach LLC distributor** generated sales of **$3.5bn** which is the highest distributors and **Hansen Group** is the least sales distributor based on our 
analysis.

## Recommendations

- More investigation should be done in France to see and know why sales was only generated in the year 2018 as there was no sales for 2017, 2018 and 2022.

- The top distributors and top sales team should be given incentives and awards this can also encourage others to do well.

- The company should consider hiring more staff to the business. 

- Some top staff should be posted to countries and cities where we have less sales to boost up sales productivity.
